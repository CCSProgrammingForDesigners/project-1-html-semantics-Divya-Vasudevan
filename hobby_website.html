            <h1>The Story of Bharatanatyam</h1>
            <p>
                Bharatanatyam, is a major genre of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu. Traditionally,
                Bharatanatyam has been a solo dance that was performed exclusively by women, and it expressed South
                Indian
                religious themes and spiritual ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                This style of dance is noted for its fixed upper torso, legs bent or knees flexed out combined with
                spectacular footwork, a sophisticated vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes and
                face
                muscles.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The theoretical foundations of Bharatanatyam are found in Natya Shastra, the ancient Hindu text of
                performance arts. Natya Shastra is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni, and its first
                complete
                compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE. The text, describes the theory of Thaandava dance
                (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhaava, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing
                postures - all of which are part of Indian classical dances.

                    <h3>Devadasis, anti-dance movement, colonial ban and the decline</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some colonial Indologists and modern authors have stated Bharatanatyam is a descendant of an
                        ancient Devadasi (literally, servant girls of Deva temples) culture, suggesting historical
                        origins
                        to 300 BCE to 300 CE.Historic sculpture and texts do describe and project dancing girls, as
                        well as
                        temple quarters dedicated to women, but they do not state them to be courtesans and prostitutes
                        as
                        alleged by early colonial Indologists. According to James Lochtefeld, Bharatanatyam remained
                        exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century, and it appeared on stage outside the
                        temples
                        only in the 20th century. With the arrival of colonial East India Company officials rule in the
                        18th century, and the establishment of British colonial rule in the 19th, many classical Indian
                        dance forms were ridiculed and discouraged, and these performance arts declined. In 1910, the
                        Madras Presidency of the British Empire altogether banned temple dancing, and with it the
                        Bharatanatyam tradition within Hindu temples.

                    <h3>Post colonial era: revival and rebirth</h3>
                    <p>
                        The 1910 ban triggered powerful protests against the stereotyping and dehumanization of temple
                        dancers. The classical art revivalists such as E. Krishna Iyer, a lawyer and someone who had
                        learnt
                        the Bharatanatyam dance, questioned the cultural discrimination and the assumed connection,
                        asking
                        how killing performance arts could end any evils in a society? Iyer was arrested and sentenced
                        to
                        prison on charges of nationalism, who while serving out his prison term persuaded his fellow
                        political prisoners to support Bharatanatyam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the British colonial government enforced laws to suppress Bharatanatyam and all Hindu
                        temple
                        dances, some from the West such as the American dancer Esther Sherman moved to India in 1930,
                        learnt Indian classical dances, changed her name to Ragini Devi, and joined the movement to
                        save
                        and revive Bharatanatyam and other ancient dance arts. The Indian independence movement in
                        early
                        20th century, already in progress, became a period of cultural ferment and initiated an effort
                        by
                        its people to reclaim their culture and rediscover history. In this period of cultural and
                        political turmoil, instead of Bharatnatyam becoming extinct, it expanded out of Hindu temples
                        and
                        was revived as a mainstream dance by Bharatnatyam artists such as Rukmini Devi Arundale and
                        Balasaraswati. They championed and performed the Pandanallur (Kalakshetra) and Thanjavur styles
                        of
                        Bharatanatyam, respectively. In late 20th century, Tamil Hindu migrants reintroduced the
                        Bharatanatyam traditions of temple dancing in British Tamil temples.

            <p>
                Bharata Natyam is traditionally a team performance art that consists of a female solo dancer,
                accompanied
                by musicians and one or more singers. The theory behind the musical notes, vocal performance and the
                dance
                movement trace back to the ancient Natya Shastra, and many Sanskrit and Tamil texts such as the
                Abhinaya
                Darpana. The repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like all major classical Indian dance forms, follows the
                three
                categories of performance in the Natya Shastra. These are Nritta (Nirutham), Nritya (Niruthiyam) and
                Natya
                (Natyam).

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Nritta</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Nritta performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The viewer is
                        presented
                        with pure movement in Bharatanatyam, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed,
                        range and pattern.

                    <h3>Nritya</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Nritya is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings,
                        storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a nritya, the
                        dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set
                        to
                        musical notes.

                    <p>
                        The Natyam is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer
                        where
                        the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the
                        underlying
                        story. A Natya incorporates the elements of a Nritya.

            <p>The traditional Bharatanatyam performance follows a seven-part order of presentation. This set of items

            <h2>Attire</h2>
            <p>
                The attire of a Bharatanatyam dancer resembles a Tamil Hindu's bridal dress. It consists of a tailor
                fitted
                brilliantly colored Sari, with a special pleated cloth stitched that falls in front and opens like a
                hand
                fan when she flexes her knees or performs footwork. The Sari is worn in a special way, wrapping the
                back
                and body contour tightly, past one shoulder and its end then held by a jewelry belt at the waist.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is typically adorned with jewelry, outlining her head or hair, on ear, nose and neck. Her face has
                conventional makeup, eyes lined and ringed by collyrium which help viewers see her eye expressions. To
                her
                ankles, she wraps one or more leather anklets [ Ghungroos ]. Her hair is tied up in the traditional
                way,
                often braided in with fragrant flowers. The fingers and feet outlines may be partially colored red with
                kumkum powder, a costume tradition that helps the audience more easily view her hand gestures.</p>

            <h2>Modern revival: schools and training centers</h2>
            <p>
                Bharatanatyam rapidly expanded after India gained freedom from the British rule in 1947. It is now the
                most
                popular classical Indian dance style in India and enjoys high degree of support in expatriate Indian
                communities. In the second half of the 20th century, Bharatanatyam has been to Indian dance tradition
                what
                ballet has been in the West. Major cities in India now have numerous schools that offer lessons in
                Bharatanatyam, and these cities host hundreds of shows every year. Outside India, Bharatanatyam is a
